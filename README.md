# DPLearning

This folder contains documentation (code, PowerPoint, and report) from my final project for STAT 672 - Statistical Learning and Data Analytics at George Mason University, Spring 2019.

This repository seeks to provide interested readers a centralized place to read about Differentially Private (henceforth referred to as DP) Learning and source relevant code, literature, and illustrative examples on the subject.

I hope to continue updating this repository as I clean up the code and report text and provide greater detail about the materials I sourced when writing this project.

For starters, here are some great links that I referenced when writing the paper:

* https://secml.github.io/class4/
* https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/differential-privacy
* https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~asarwate/nips2017/
* https://gitlab.com/dp-stats/dp-stats/tree/master/dp_stats

Normalized data for the project was sourced from <a href="https://github.com/mohamedameen93/German-Traffic-Sign-Classification-Using-TensorFlow">mohammedameen93's excellent repository</a>. Feel free to e-mail me at nathuan329@gmail.com if you have any questions (I will try my best to remember this project and answer them).
